# Flag Bank

![Flagbank](https://github.com/7h30ry/writeups/assets/51336409/63a07bba-ca25-4bb0-80db-10b26f170f8f)

This was basically an easy one.
After runing the binary file i got this
```
🏦 Welcome to the Flag Bank! To purchase a Flag costs $20000, but your current balance is $10000. Purchase a Test Flag at $3000
[1] Purchase Flag - $20000
[2] Purchase Test Flag - $3000
[3] View current balance
```
Since i know that there $10000 in balance and i need $20000 to purchase the 
I did to pick the secode option, i was then prompted with
```
Number of Test Flags do you need?
```
so i thought if i endered a positive number let say 3, money will be deducted so i decided to input a negative number -5 insted
and my money was increased, so i was able to purcase the flag

We were given a zip file and Zip Password: Cyberlympics2023

Anfter unziping the file i got a file named flagishere.jpg but it wasn't actually a jpg it was a pdf file

![Screenshot from 2023-09-24 17-51-14](https://github.com/7h30ry/writeups/assets/51336409/6e097db3-3602-424b-acf8-73e401728b70)

so i did ```mv flagishere.jpg flagishere.pdf``` and got a pdf file

next thing i did was 
```
exiftool flagishere.pdf
```
and i got part of the flag

Next i open up the pdf file

There was nothing like a flag inside, so probably it's there and i cam't see it, so i highlted the whole page and copied everything
and paste it some where else and got a cipher ```D9_Hd0c==0D_>bE`>bdN```

![Screenshot from 2023-09-24 17-59-09](https://github.com/7h30ry/writeups/assets/51336409/c78991b7-7db5-49e9-8f99-4d21f294aa65)

So decrypting it using ROT47 i got the secode half of the flag

We were just asked ```How Many Packets were captured```

![Sabek-intro](https://github.com/7h30ry/writeups/assets/51336409/beda1a1a-fb54-484f-8a3a-52551cba83d8)

Opening up the pcap file with wireshark, at the botttom right we see the number of packets
```FLAG: acdfCTF{3322}```

For this using the same pcap file
At the top bar in wireshark go to

```
View > Time Display Format > Date and Time of Day
```
once the seetings have been changed you will see the normal time format in the wireshark, juat copy the time for the first packet
whcih is the one at the very top, and the packet at the very last.. Join it and that is the flag

I used the strings and grep command to get the flag

```
strings easyrev | grep CTF
```

This challenge is based on Command injection but we need to bypass the black list

Firstly ecode your command in base64
```
echo "cat flag.txt" | base64
Y2F0IGZsYWcudHh0Cg==
```

Payload

```
echo Y2F0IGZsYWcudHh0Cg==|base6'4' -d|bas'h'
