<h3> Flag Appraisal (MetaCTF July 2024) </h3>

Hi everyone, this is `0x1337` also known as `h4cky0u`

My github account was placed as spam so i'm currently waiting for Github support to fix it

So today I participated in the MetaCTF Monthly Challenge

And i'll be showing you how I solved the Reverse Engineering challenge called `Flag Appraisal`

I actually never got to submit the flag because I ended up solving it 3 minutes after the ctf ended due to skill issue and one thing is that the ctf runs for just 2 hours
